---- No longer supported or used.
----- vcd_python_c   is used. It has "C" program core.

local script "run" should run the demo.
python2.7 is expected here.  You can add "python" to the invocation line (inside run) if Your linux/mac is 
not allowing "#! /usr/bin/python" invocation.


the scripts reside in pybin/ directory.

typing :   pybin/vcd_python.py  will print short help and example.

vcd.py is the user written module called by "run".

it defines two "must" functions: observer and set_var.
vcd.py looks for clock going down and then, checks the AXI bus status.
it counts number of bytes moving around and keeps score.


this software used extensively on macs and linuxes :)
if You try it on windows, i would appreciate a short explanation, that i can add.

any feedback is positive.


the example here is AXI master talking to AXI slave.
