we swutched to python 3

run_example0 is script to run first example.
before that, You need to compile the lexer. 
goto lexer directory and there is "compile" script.
the result of that script (it just runs gcc) is executable "verilog_lexer".
this executable should be copied to Your local bin in one of the $PATH specified directories.


all temp files in lexer are en-gitted, so if something goes wrong, You can start from later stage.

enjoy.

more examples will be coming.
