This README is about python3.* (latest is ok). Before You start, You need python development library.
on linux, try (or similar) :      sudo apt-get install python-dev



first go to vpi directory and compile the library. README is there.
there is also vpi7_nc_27.so compiled already, it fits linux fedora and probably most of linux dists.
!!!! recompile the .so if You can - it might be not the final version.

this README can  help You to compile the library to icarus, vcs or ncverilog.

in examples directory look for sqrt and uart examples/

both are small examples of verilog-python connection.
before runing the example, it is good idea to create the vpi library.
examples are for icarus simulator, but any simulator can be used.

SQRT:
it has square root DUT and modest testbench (tb.v)
"comp" script compiles it for icarus
"run"  will run the icarus.


UART:
    two uarts in testbench (tb.v) 
    one is real rtl, the other one modeled by python. this useful when some modules are not ready 
    for integration before the others. You can prepare empty verilog module  will all inputs/outputs.
    and write model n python to behave as the module. Later,when real rtl is ready, it can be run in "Aluka" mode, 
    where instead of forcing the outputs, it compares values of the rtl outputs to those of python.

the setup:
    rtl-one sends characters to python-one, that one loops them back.
    they are received by rtl-one and compared/checked for accuracy.
    i played with difference in baudrates to see when wrong data begins.


the generation and comparison is done using python. (verilog.py)
python is kept simple. usually i dont like global variables. here they are used just for clarity.

last minute jtag regfile example was added. it has it's own README file.


example of NCVERILOG activation:
   ncverilog +nc64bit rtl/tb.v -f test.files  +nospecify +no  \
   timingcheck +access+rw+ +loadvpi="/home/igreenb1/software/vpi/vpi7_nc_27:vpit_Register    Tfs" \
   +ncgateloopwarn +libext+.v+  

example of VCS activation:

vcs  \
    -notice  -full64 -v2005 +v2k -debug_pp -debug_all   \   
    +vpi -load /home/ilia/software/vpi/vpi7_nc_27.so:vpit_RegisterTfs  \
    rtl/tb.v \
   -f test.files \
   -y ../../container/rtl \

./simv


example of CVC64 activation:
cvc64 \
    +acc  \
    +loadvpi=/home/iliag/software/vpi/vpi7_nc_27.so:vpit_RegisterTfs \
    rtl/tb.v \
   -f test.files \
    +libext+.v+ \
    -y ../../vsrc -y ../../vsrc2 \

./cvcsim







common veri functions:

veri.peek(Path) :
   Path is something like "tb.dut.dma.state"
   it returns string with length of wire or reg width. the string is made out of 0,1,x,z characters.
   this is the current value of the variable. 
   You are not allowed to write subbus path, like "state[3:0]".  
   veri.peek returns always full string, and You can chop, substring it in python.


veri.force(Path,Value)
   Path is same as in veri.peek
   Value is always string.
   it can be one of three:
    "12345"   - decimal string, it can be up to 32bits. no "-" allowed.
    "0xabcd"  -  hex string. width same restrictions.
    "0b01010101010xz" - binary string. unlimited length. can include x and z characters.

    veri.force is not hard force, it is "deposit"
    there is also hard_force in the library. it comes with release function.




veri.stime()
    return current simulation time. dont see much need for it.

veri.finish()
    finish and exit simulation.
    sys.exit()  may also do the trick, alas without going through verilog simulator finishing stage (depends on simulator).

veri.listing(Path,Depth,Filename):
    like veri.listing("tb","1000","deep.list")
    produce file calle "deep.list" with all current values of all variables, from Path to depth of Depth.
    sorry "0" depth is just like one. i will fix it sometimes to indicated indefinet depth.


less common:

veri.peek_mem(Path,ind)
    like in veri.peek("tb.mem","10")
    returns value from two dimensional  array

veri.force_mem(Path,ind,val)
    forces value into two dimensional  array

veri.peek_3d(Path,ind0,ind1)
    like in veri.peek("tb.mem","10","20")
    returns value from three dimensional  array

veri.force_3d(Path,ind0,ind1,val)
    forces value into three dimensional  array
